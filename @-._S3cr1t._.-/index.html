                        Programming is my life. <br><br>
	I began programming by mistake. Around the time floppy disks and drive disks were used, video games were simple. I started playing this game called Tibia, which was fun, but it didn’t have the extra “umph” that I was looking for.  So, I looked into an open-source Tibia, which was called Open-Tibia or OT for short. I joined this server, and rose up the ranks eventually becoming an administrator on the server. The owner of the server asked me, “Can you make this LUA script? I need a scripter.” I hesitated, but responded with agreeance that I could. I didn’t know a single thing about programming, so I had to learn fast, and I did. I made a very thrown together version of the script, which was simply giving items for a quest. After that, I hosted a local server, and started screwing around on it. This was when I first experienced being a programmer. 
	<br><br>LUA was my first language, but it didn’t seal the deal. I didn’t really care too much for programming at that point. Java is when I started caring about programming. Me and a couple of friends hosted a server on a game called Minecraft. This was many, many years after I went on to be a LUA scripter. We wanted “plugins” that no one had, thankfully Minecraft was so entirely sandbox that you could do that. Our custom plugins got the attention of a lot of people, and we gradually became the most successful and popular server on Minecraft.  Being the owner of that server, I took a large amount of the proceeds from donations and other things. The programming used in Minecraft is Java, so I needed to know Java in-order to develop for the server. Most people on staff already knew how to program Minecraft plugins, but I didn’t. I felt the need to prove that I was useful by developing small plugins here and there, nothing too extravagant. By this time, I had gone into the military and was still hosting the server. As we increasingly became popular, we started getting people who would come to us and ask if we could make a custom plugin for them. It wasn’t cheap, but people didn’t seem to mind. Being in the military, I was financially secure. The only thing I needed to spend money on, was a cellphone bill. Everything else was provided to me. So, naturally, I had the most saved up. As people increasingly asked us for commissions for Minecraft plugins, we sat down one day and said, we need to do something about this, either legit it or quit it. We chose to legit it. As I said before, I was the only person who had funds at the time, so I bought the domain names, trademarks, copyrights, and for “BattlePlugins”. I became the CEO and co-owner of the company. Many of the people left, or didn’t show as much commitment, so eventually I ended up becoming the sole owner of the company. People saw us as a programming firm, so that’s what we became. We did various small projects, websites, and some larger applications. Our company grew to about 49 employees. 
	<br><br>Being the only person not qualified in my business, I felt the need to educate myself. So, I went to college originally to be in Human Services and Psychology. I wanted to help people so, I developed a website called “HelpingDepression” which allowed people to anonymously talk to me and other operators on a website if they needed someone to talk to. After a while, I knew my true calling was Computer Science, so I changed my major. I think I knew this is where I had belong all along, and I’m glad that I’m in this major. I hope to pursue higher education and eventually become a professor in Computer Science.
