I guess this is the part where we sit down and have a heart to heart. The reason you're seeing this page is because you've been banned.<br>
Now, I don't know who banned you or even why they banned you. But, they more than likely banned you for a good reason.<br>
The rules we have on this website are simple. 
<ul style="color:black">
	<li><span style = "color:white"> Don't try to be malicious.</span></li>
	<li><span style = "color:white">Don't try to do stuff you're not suppose to do. </span></li>
	<li><span style = "color:white">Follow the Tibia rules. </span></li>
	<li><span style = "color:white">Don't make multiple accounts.</span></li>
	<li><span style = "color:white">Don't break our terms and conditions.</span></li>
</ul>
These are all very basic rules, and we expect you to abide by them.<br><br>

It is unfortunate to see you go, but I think it's for the best. I wish you the best on your endevours. If you truly believe there is some type of mistake, you can email us at <span style = "color:red; display:in-line">support@tibiamarket.net</span>.
